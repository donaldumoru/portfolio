  "title": "Runet-Software website redesign",
  "overview": "Runet-Software is a company that develops high level structural engineering software based on the Eurocodes, with over 50,000 installations worldwide. Their website plays a key role in how users discover products, compare options, and make purchases but over time, the website had become very difficult to navigate and visually outdated. When I joined Ambianti B.V for an internship, my task was to redesign and redevelop the entire platform. The goal was to create a modern, intuitive, and efficient platform that not only improves the user experience for engineers, architects, and other potential customers but also aligns with Runet-Software’s business goals.",
